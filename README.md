# Ultimate_tic_tac_toe_1

Many functions or features are similar to those in the original tictactoe game, which we had chosen from the provided list of games. We modified those functions to account for the larger scale of our project, compared to theirs. 

The original game can be found in chapter ten in the textbook: "Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python" 
https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/chapter10.html

All other code is original and written by the authors of this Github. 

We took inspiration for the rules and function of the game from https://github.com/amanvar/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe-9x9. 

We hope you enjoy!
